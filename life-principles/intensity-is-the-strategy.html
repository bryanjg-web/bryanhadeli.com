      <h1>Intensity is the strategy</h1>

      <p>Everyone's obsessed with strategy.</p>
      <p>The right framework. The perfect plan. We worship the person in the room with the smartest take.</p>
      <p>Here's what nobody tells you: strategy is where smart people hide. You get to feel productive - mapping things out, building frameworks, workshopping hypotheses - without ever doing the uncomfortable thing that would actually move the needle.</p>
      <p>Don't get me wrong - strategy is important. But most people don't realise that <b>doing the obvious thing with intensity is a strategy</b> - usually the right one.</p>

      <p>3 months into my Product role at <a href="https://hellostake.com/au"><u>Stake</u></a>, I had one job: acquire our first 1,000 users onto our new self-managed super product. We were failing. Tons of people signed up every day, but no one converted. They'd get halfway through, then vanish. A pipeline full of ghosts.</p>
      <p>So I built the most beautiful issue tree you've ever seen. Signups × conversion rate. Sub-buckets. Hypotheses. I was so proud of this thing I would've framed it. I took it to Ollie (our CPO) like I'd just solved the business.</p>

      <p>He looked at it for 10 seconds. Then said:</p>
      <p><i>"Why don't you just call every customer who signed up last week but didn't finish paying?"</i></p>
      <p>(I had built the world's most sophisticated excuse not to pick up the phone)</p>
      <p>So I did. Called dozens of customers that week. Within days, the real blockers were obvious. The sign-up flow was too long. People couldn't find their TFNs. They didn't trust us yet. Over time as we fixed these pain points, conversion picked up. We hit the 1,000 number after a year of hustle. Not because I got smarter. Because I stopped strategising and started doing.</p>
      <p>Simple lesson, right? Do the obvious thing with intensity.</p>
      <p>I thought I got it.</p>
      <p>I didn't. Not even close.</p>

      <p>That came at Amazon. Rocio, my GM, ran 3 teams and 60+ people. A million things fighting for her attention every single day. And yet - she was obsessively in the details. <i>My</i> details.</p>
      <p>A product listing not displaying properly on site? She'd find it. (We managed 100K+ products.) All but one product image facing the same way? She'd message me to flip it. Top sellers not ranking on obvious search keywords? I'd hear about it regardless of what time it was.</p>
      <p>She was my David Goggins - except instead of ultramarathons, she was catching a rogue shoe photo at 9pm on a Tuesday.</p>

        </div>
        <figcaption class="image-caption"><i>You thought I was kidding? Nope.</i></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>And then I started becoming Rocio.</p>
      <p>Checking my own listings before she could. Sweating the details that used to feel too small to care about. Eventually, I was the one finding issues first - and it worked. My category nearly doubled in a year with profitability at record highs - not from one brilliant strategy, but from a thousand tiny details executed relentlessly.</p>
      <p>So stop overthinking the plan. The obvious answer is almost always the right one - the question is whether you'll execute it with enough intensity to matter.</p>
