      <h1>Energy is a skill</h1>

      <p>Here's something nobody tells you when you're starting your career:</p>
      <p><b>You have almost nothing to offer.</b></p>

      <p>You're going to walk into rooms where people have been doing this longer than you've been alive. People who've forgotten more about the industry than you currently know. Your instinct will be: <em>I need to learn more. I need to catch up.</em></p>
      <p>Wrong move. (Well - not wrong. But it's not your edge. Not yet.)</p>
      <p><b>Your edge is energy.</b></p>

      <p>I was 19 when I dove headfirst into my first startup <a href="https://hellostake.com/au"><u>Stake</u></a> - a brokerage-free US trading app that grew explosively during COVID lockdowns. I juggled multiple roles (totalling ~ 3 years) just to support this growth, working out of an old jewellery shop in Edgecliff with no windows. A little dingey. But so much fun.</p>

      <p>Then the GameStop crisis hit. Customer order volumes surged, our servers collapsed, we halted all trades, and customers lost it. Reviews flooded with hate. People threatened to burn down our office. (It wasn't exactly a fortress either.)</p>

      </figure>
      <p class="image-caption"><i>Not exactly the type of reviews you want to see…</i></p>

      <p>Thousands of messages like these. Every day. For two weeks. Everyone's job became customer service rep.</p>

      <p>Most people would spiral. But I was honestly excited - when else would you have the opportunity to turnaround a company during crisis? I walked into that same windowless room every morning, wrote in big numbers how many support tickets I'd smash out that day on our team leaderboard, and got to work. I'd even laugh with colleagues about customers mistaking us for the other <a href="https://stake.com/"><u>Stake</u></a> (crypto casino). </p>
      
      <p>And the crazy part? <i>Other</i> people loosened up too. The team went from <i>"Holy f*ck Bryan, are we ever going to recover?"</i> to <i>"This is going to be so funny to look back on in a few years."</i> (looking back 6 years later, can confirm it's pretty funny)</p>

      <p>That energy was the most valuable thing I brought to that room. Not experience (barely had any). Not genius insights (it was pretty simple - people hated us). Energy.</p>

      <p><b>Here's the thing about energy: it's contagious. In both directions.</b></p>
        
      <p>One person starts complaining and within 30 seconds the whole room is slumped, arms crossed, agreeing everything's broken. But enthusiasm works the same way in reverse.</p>

      <p>Shaan Puri <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4AkAaF_Mw"><u>has this great framing</u></a> that enthusiasm is basically a loan from the future. You're borrowing excitement about where things are headed and spending it today, before you've earned the right to be that confident. And weirdly, that's exactly what makes people want to follow you.</p>
        
      <p>So you don't need decades of experience (yet). You just need to show up like you give a damn.</p>
